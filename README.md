# Welcome to my site! âœ¨
This is the behind-the-scenes of my personal website. I had a lot of fun designing and coding this, which are skills I haven't exercised in nearly 10 years! It was also a great exercise in knowing and being able to represent my full self.

Thanks for stopping by, and I hope you enjoy! ðŸ¥°
