        <h1>Milyza Flores (she/her) is a Filipinx Product Manager & Community Organizer from Queens who always brings her whole self. ✨</h1>

        <p>Hi, I’m Milyza. &nbsp;🏳️‍🌈I like to think my distinctive name and I are perfect for each other: I’m a small girl with a big presence (and even bigger hair); I am lively, passionate, and a force to be reckoned with.</p>

        <p>I was born & raised in Queens (represent!) to an amazing family 🇵🇭. Growing up apt and ambitious, I started my first business buying wholesale goods to retail online at the age of 10 — the first of many ventures. When I got to college, I developed my analytical thinking by studying mathematics and brought my savvy to the corporate world during my two summers in investment banking at Goldman Sachs. I was offered to return after graduation, but ultimately pursued a career in technology instead. Since then, I've led teams for New Products at <a href="https://www.pebblepost.com/">PebblePost</a> and Content Discovery at <a href="https://voice.com">Voice</a> as a Product Manager 👩🏽‍💻. Through all these endeavors, I've learned that I'm capable of working exceptionally hard to achieve amazing things.</p>

        <p>I bring the same dedication to my personal aspirations, which are to always be there for and with those I love, and to always strive to be better while still knowing I am enough. And I do everything with intention, reflection and gratitude, which allows me to live a life that is happy and wonderful every day.</p>

        <p>Thank you for allowing me share who I am with you — I hope to <a href="mailto:milyzaf@gmail.com">get to know you too</a>!</p>
