        <h1>Milyza Flores (she/her) is a Filipina Product Manager from Queens who always brings her whole self. âœ¨</h1>

        <p>Hi, Iâ€™m Milyza. I like to think my distinctive name and I are perfect for each other: Iâ€™m a small girl with a big presence (and even bigger hair); I am lively, passionate, and a force to be reckoned with.</p>

        <p>I was born & raised in Queens (represent!) to an amazing family ðŸ‡µðŸ‡­. Growing up apt and ambitious, I started my first business buying wholesale goods to retail online at the age of 10 and had many more ventures generating over $15k from then until college. When I got to college, I developed my analytical skills by studying mathematics and brought my savvy to the corporate world by spending two summers in investment banking at Goldman Sachs. I was offered to return after graduation, but ultimately decided to follow my heart and pursue a career in technology instead. This brought me to <a href="https://www.pebblepost.com/">PebblePost</a>, the leading digital-to-direct mail marketing company, where I lead the New Products team as the first Product Manager hire ðŸ’Œ. Through all these endeavors, I've learned that I'm capable of working exceptionally hard to achieve amazing things.</p>

        <p>I bring the same dedication to my personal aspirations, which are to always be there for and with those I love, and to always know I am enough yet still strive to be better. I do everything with intention, reflection and gratitude in order to cultivate my happiness and wellbeing, which in turn helps me live a life that is wonderful every day.</p>

        <p>Thank you for allowing me share who I am with you â€” I hope to <a href="mailto:milyzaf@gmail.com">get to know you too</a>!</p>
